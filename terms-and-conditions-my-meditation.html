    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions for My Meditation Timer App</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
                      By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                      automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                      that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                      allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                      our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                      extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                      to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                      versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                      database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                      to it, still belong to Edge Effect Media.
                    </p> <p>
                      Edge Effect Media is committed to ensuring that the app is
                      as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                      reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                      its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                      charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                      clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                    </p> <p>
                      The MyMeditation Timer app stores and processes personal data that
                      you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                      Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                      access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                      not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                      removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                      official operating system of your device. It could make your
                      phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                      compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                      that the MyMeditation Timer app won’t work properly or at all.
                    </p> <div><p>
                        The app does use third party services that declare their own
                        Terms and Conditions.

                      You should be aware that there are certain things that
                      Edge Effect Media will not take responsibility for. Certain
                      functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                      internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                      by your mobile network provider, but Edge Effect Media
                      cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                      functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                      have any of your data allowance left.
                    </p> <p></p> <p>
                      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                      should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                      mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                      be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                      the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                      other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                      charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                      (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                      you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                      using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                      received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                    </p> <p>
                      Along the same lines, Edge Effect Media cannot always take
                      responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                      make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                      battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                      Edge Effect Media cannot accept responsibility.
                    </p> <p>
                      With respect to Edge Effect Media’s responsibility for your
                      use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                      bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                      updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                      to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                      to you. Edge Effect Media accepts no liability for any
                      loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                      relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                    </p> <p>
                      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                      currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                      both systems(and for any additional systems we
                      decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                      and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                      using the app. Edge Effect Media does not promise that it
                      will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                      and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                      installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                      accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                      also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                      it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                      Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                      rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                      (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                      from your device.
                    </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
