          What patterns do you play out when you feel stressed, lonely, disconnected, unappreciated, helpless?  Maybe you revist old addictions, or storm out & quit your job, or get angry & break stuff, hold resentment for people around you, blow shit up (metaphorically & physically).  I know ive struggled with this,  and I feel like I'm at the mercy to it.  That when this happens, I play out this pattern.  And a very handy skill to have in your toolset is how not to play out your pattern, & move beyond it.
          </p>
          <p>  
          These patterns we play out are a way of communicating to the world.   In some primitive sense, our mind has a default response to the stress or pressure we're recieving, we bark at the kids since we dont know how else to handle it given our level of dis-ease like major stress, anxiety or alientation. 
          You are communicating to your surroundings that you need space, need love, need protection,  and you do this <b>through</b> anger at other people, anger at yourself, burst out crying, shaming yourself or others, eating, reaching for something you don't want to do, you get grumpy.  These are some signals that you may be carrying out a pattern to communicate.
          </p>
          <p> 
          Now that we know that we may be carrying out these unconcious patterns, how can we not do them?
          </p>
          <p>
          Our goal is to become aware of whatever our pattern is.  Once we become aware of it, we don't want to judge it, remember this is the way the subconscious mind has learnt to get love or feel protected, or not feel trapped.   Once we become aware of it, we are able to then <b>choose</b> a different way of reacting. 
           When we realise were carrying out a pattern, take a few deep breaths, run some affirmations & ground yourself in your body.   Think of it like sheltering from a storm, just get through the initial wave, & try to be aware as possible.  See yourself following out whatever your pattern is.   Whatever the thoughts that you may be having, "these people are so stupid", "this is bs", "I'm a crappy person",  "I'm selfish", "im bad for doing this", "it shouldn't be like this". Know you are not any of this,  this is the way the mind has learnt to deal with the situation, but your job is to be aware, not judge these thoughts, & ultimately choose a different path (although this can be a lot harder then it sounds). 
         </p>
         <p>
           This can be hard to get used to, but like anything it requires practice, & with this you become more proficient.   And as you get to know yourself &, the patterns you play out, it becomes easier to choose something different.  Remember if you just have a little awareness each time, it will eventually build into something you can use, & eventually choose your reaction.  It's like weilding a fire hose. At the beginning you didn't even realise you were holding one, then as you build up awareness,  you become stronger at welding it, maybe turning it off, maybe using its power for something different.  But ultimately realising you are in control, & you get to choose your reaction.    
         </p>
         <p>
          And remember all your body was trying to tell the world is, i need space, i need love, i need protection.  So as we become aware of our pattern, we can get these through other mindful means, & sometimes its just a deep breath that brings you back to calm waters.
          Whats your plan when you realise your playing out a pattern?
        </p>
        <p>
           Mines take some deep breaths, feel by whole body, realse stress & energy through by breathing, feel i am loved & that i am whole, say i am loved & strong.  Sit there in this meditation till the intial wave of action has ended.   Then remind myself with affirmations that everything is alright.
