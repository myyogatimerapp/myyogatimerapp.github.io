            Have you ever heard the phrase <b>'Keep your eye on the prize'</b>? 
          </p>

            <p>
              Why is it we have to keep your eye on it? If we want it, surely we don't need reminding? The fact is, our mind isn't wired for long term thinking. It likes short term gains like comfort & societal acceptance. Even worse, if it doesn't have a long term vision, it's more likely to devolve into negative thinking. If we're not constantly reminding ourselves of a bigger, long term vision for ourselves, our mind will default to an easier, well-worn path, which more often than not isn't in our best interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            How can we keep ourselves reminded of a long term vision, and <b>keep our eyes on the prize</b>? There are many ways which are referred to as <b>triggers</b>. Reminders we can use throughout the day that remind us to come back to a longer-term vision for ourselves. This could be things like: every time you walk through a door, you remind yourself you're grateful to be alive. It can even be actual reminders you set on your phone that go off every hour. Use them to come back to a grounded position & realign yourself away from the short term thinking at that moment, to longer-term qualities, visions, or plan.
          </p>

          <p>
           One <b>trigger</b> I'll talk about today is a <b>vision board</b>. This is a collage of people, events, or things we can use to remind ourselves of the vision we want to move toward. In this post, I'll cover some tips to get the most out of your vision board.
          </p>
          <h3>Stick to people not events or things</h3>
          <p>
            Choose people over events or things. The end goal of our vision board is to adopt the <b>mindset</b> & <b>identity</b> of someone who can achieve the things we admire & desire. It's easier to identify with real people who have achieved the things we want to achieve, rather than with imaginative figures. The people you do choose should embody multiple elements of your vision &dreams. The more you can identify with them, the easier it will be to see yourself in their shoes, doing the things that they are capable of. We are aiming at a 'state of being' that these people embody; not achieving things they have achieved, but being someone who is capable of achieving these things.

          </p>
          <h3>Visit your board often</h3>
          <p>
            We are most primed for influence when we wake up in the morning. It's like loading in the program the rest of your day is going to run on. Use this to your advantage & prime your mind with the future you see. If you haven't provided an alternative, our brains default to short term desires and habits. By priming our mind with a longer-term vision as soon as we wake up, we can guide the day towards the future we want.
          </p>
          <p>
           Notice when you lose vision throughout the day. Maybe you lack energy, you're inundated with heavy emotional thoughts or you feel a lack of purpose. This is evidence you've lost sight of a long term vision, qualities, or goals. Revisit your board to gain <b>clarity</b>.</p>
           <p>
            Align with your vision before bed. What we process during sleep can be influenced by what we process leading up to sleep. By providing a framework (our vision) through which the day's events can be processed, the more we will lean towards our future vision.   
          </p>
          <h3>
            Conclusion
          </h3>
          <p>
            What's this got to do with doing yoga? Ultimately, things like yoga, exercise & movement need some long term vision behind them to make them appealing. Without a deeper reason to get up and do yoga over watching tv or staying in bed, we're going to do the latter. <b>We have to be active in creating a longer-term vision to strive for.</b> We can't expect it to land in our laps. Use a vision board as a trigger to remind yourself of why you are here, what you expect of yourself & life and who you want to be. Everything else, like our ability to consistently do yoga & movement, is downstream of this. Make reminding yourself of a longer-term vision a <a href="./priorities">priority.
